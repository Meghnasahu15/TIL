<h2> In C++, the next_permutation function is an inbuilt algorithm provided by the Standard Template Library (STL) that generates the next lexicographically greater permutation of a sequence.</h1>
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3};

    // Generating permutations of the vector
    do {
        for (int num : nums) {
            std::cout << num << " ";
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    } while (std::next_permutation(nums.begin(), nums.end()));

    return 0;
}
```cpp

<h3> In this example, the next_permutation function is used inside a do-while loop to generate all possible permutations of the vector nums. The loop continues until next_permutation returns false, indicating that there are no more permutations.

Note that the elements in the range must be ordered in ascending order initially to obtain the permutations in lexicographically increasing order. If the elements are not sorted, you can use the std::sort function to sort the range before using next_permutation </h3>
