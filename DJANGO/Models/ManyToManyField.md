```cpp
from django.db import models

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    authors = models.ManyToManyField('Author')

class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
```
<h3>In Django, the ManyToManyField is a field type used in a model to establish a many-to-many relationship with another model. It allows a record in one model to be related to multiple records in another model, and vice versa.</h3>
<br>
<h3>In the example above, the Book model has a ManyToManyField called authors, which establishes a many-to-many relationship with the Author model. This means that a book can have multiple authors, and an author can be associated with multiple books.

Django automatically creates an intermediate table to manage the many-to-many relationship between the Book and Author models. This intermediate table stores the relationships between the books and authors.

You can perform various operations on a ManyToManyField, such as adding or removing related objects, accessing the related objects, filtering based on related objects, and more. Django provides a convenient API to work with many-to-many relationships and handles the underlying database operations for you.

Note that when using a ManyToManyField, you need to ensure that both models (Book and Author in the example) are defined before the other, as Django requires knowledge of both models to create the intermediate table correctly.
